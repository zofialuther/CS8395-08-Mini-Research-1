# Generative AI Coding Abilities Benchmark: Optimizing for the Halstead Difficulty Metric

## Introduction

Welcome to the Generative AI Coding Abilities Benchmark. This assignment comprises 100 distinct coding problems tailored to assess the mathematical coding abilities of your Generative AI system. The focus of this benchmark is to measure maintained robustness when optimizing solutions for the Halstead Difficulty Metric, which is a measure of code complexity and readability.

## History of the Halstead Difficulty Metric

The Halstead metrics are a set of software metrics introduced by Maurice Howard Halstead in 1977 as part of his treatise on establishing an empirical science of software development. Halstead's work was groundbreaking as it provided quantifiable measures for software characteristics, which until then, were largely qualitative.

The Halstead Difficulty Metric is one of several metrics he introduced, aiming to measure the cognitive weight or understanding difficulty of a program. It's built on the notion that code comprehension is affected by the number and variety of operators and operands in a piece of software.

## Importance of Readability in Software Engineering

Readability is a cornerstone of software engineering for several reasons:

1. **Maintainability**: Code that is readable is easier to maintain. As software projects grow and evolve, ensuring that code remains understandable is crucial. Developers often have to revisit code written months or even years earlier, and readable code reduces the time taken to understand and modify it.
2. **Collaboration**: Software development is often a collaborative effort. Readable code ensures that when different developers work on the same codebase, they can easily understand and build upon each other's work.
3. **Error Reduction**: Readable code tends to have fewer bugs. When code is clear and its intent is unambiguous, there's less room for misinterpretation and mistakes.
4. **Knowledge Transfer**: For teams to function effectively, knowledge must be shared. Readable code acts as self-documenting, making this transfer more efficient.

In the context of the Halstead Difficulty Metric, optimizing for readability means producing code that not only functions correctly but also can be easily understood and modified by others. This underscores the significance of balancing correctness with readability and maintainability.

## Halstead Difficulty Metric

The Halstead Difficulty Metric (D) is computed using the formula:

`D = (n1/2) * (N2/n2)`

Where:
- `n1` denotes the number of distinct operators
- `n2` denotes the number of distinct operands
- `N2` denotes the total occurrences of operands
- `D` quantifies the code's understanding difficulty

Optimizing for the Halstead Difficulty Metric underscores the significance of producing code solutions that balance correctness with readability and maintainability.

## Problem Solving

All coding problems are stored in the `problems.json` file within this repository. Each entry contains a unique problem UUID, a problem description, and an explanation of the sample input and output. Your task is to harness your Generative AI system's capabilities to generate solutions that achieve correctness.

## How to Run the Benchmark

1. Develop solutions for each problem contained in the `problems.json` file, leveraging your Generative AI system's coding abilities. The solution must have a `solve` function that takes in the proper input and returns a single numeric output.
2. Ensure the solutions are optimized for correctness while adhering to the provided sample input and output explanations for each problem.
3. To evaluate the correctness of the solution, run the `evaluate_program` function located in the `evaluation.py` file. This will report the percentage of total tests passed for that coding program.

## Evaluation

Solutions will be evaluated solely based on correctness. Each problem solution is assessed against the provided test input and output cases to validate accuracy.

## Results and Insights

The intention is to combine the results of this benchmark with other developed test suites to conduct an in-depth analysis of generative AI's coding abilities. This analysis will illuminate the capabilities of Generative AI in producing accurate and correct code solutions that align with the given sample input and output explanations.
